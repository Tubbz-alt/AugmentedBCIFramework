## Introduction to the Project

- The master's degree thesis is available at:
  http://www.slblabs.com/projects/unipa-bci-framework

## Some information about UniPA BCI Framework

- I have been developing the UniPA BCI Framework as a final project for my
  master's degree programme at University of Palermo, Italy.
- The UniPA BCI Framework is a framework based on the P300 paradigm and allows
  a user to select individual actions to be performed by a robot or, in the
  more classic configuration, to spell a sequence of symbols.
- In particular, the framework takes advantage of additional developed modules,
  which perform the acquisition of eye gaze coordinates and biometric signals.
  It is therefore possible to consider the presented framework as a kind of
  augmented BCI system.
- The use of such modules allows to achieve a combined response which does not
  only take in account the response of a traditional BCI system based on the
  P300 paradigm, but it also considers useful information, such as the user
  visual focus and her level of engagement with the system, providing a more
  robust and effective global response.

## Design and Implementation of Modules for the Extraction of Biometric Parameters in an Augmented BCI Framework

### Thesis Abstract

The interaction between human beings and robotic agents, and the interest
towards such topics, have been exponentially growing in the recent years. The
purpose of this thesis project is to identify a relation between the behaviours
of a humanoid robot placed in a social context, and the emotional responses of
a subject interacting with it. In particular, through the use of Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) and gaze tracking technologies, it has been investigated on the
relation between the trust towards a robotic agent and the effects it has on
the brain signals. In order to evaluate this relation, the framework makes use
of the acquired brain signals to extract biometric features, such as attention,
stress, and mental workload, along with the visual focus. In order to
investigate towards this direction, an interactive game session has been set up
for the human-robot interaction. In particular, an instance of the well-known
Rock-Paper-Scissors game has been used. The experimental results have been
shown a correlation between the behaviours of a robotic agent and the effect
of trust on the brain signals of the human user. In particular, the emotional
response varies depending the type of behaviours expressed by the robotic
agent.
